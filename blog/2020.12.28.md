# Running Elixir for Free

In this post, I'll show how I was able to build a realtime, multiplayer Jeopardy game and host it for free, with all the CI/CD, logging, business insights, analytics, and alerting you would expect from a modern production system.  I love the elixir community and the tooling that's available, so I wanted to share one example of how you can plug things together for a high quality experience, without breaking the bank.

## The App

## Hosting

The most important decision was how and where to host the application.  The two main options are [Heroku](heroku.com) and [Gigalixir](https://gigalixir.com/), with Gigalixir winning out for me for this project.  While Heroku's free dynos will go to sleep after a brief period of inactivity, Gigalixir will only shut down your app if there have been no deploys in the last 30 days.  This means that there's no cold startup lag when a new visitor hits the site, as long as I'm continuing to make changes and improvements.

While there are a number of [limitations](https://gigalixir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tiers-pricing.html) on the free tier, none were deal breakers for me.  However, the database row limit of 10,000 was the one that really impacted some architecture decisions with how I handle data.  For example, there are about 6,600 old jeopardy games, each with 61 clues -- just storing that alone would blow past the limit.  Instead, I can store each game as a json file on disk, which in total is around 100MB, well below the 10GB allowance.  I'm also extremely aggressive about replicating old game data to BigQuery so that I can delete it from the Postgres database.

## Logging

[Logflare](logflare.app) lets you retain up to 3 days of logs and gives you a nice interface for searching and filtering as well.  Setting up a Gigalixir [drain](https://gigalixir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/log.html) was a good way to get started, but because it was sending plain text, Logflare couldn't parse the log's metadata out into fields.  Luckily, Logflare provides a [Logflare Logger Backend](https://hexdocs.pm/logflare_logger_backend/readme.html) that fits right in next to the basic console logger backend.  This lets you send structured logs directly to Logflare, enabling you to pick out specific fields in your searches.

![Logflare interface](logflare_interface.png)


It only takes a few lines in our config:
```
# add Logflare to our logger backends
config :logger, backends: [:console, LogflareLogger.HttpBackend]

# configure Logflare itself
config :logflare_logger_backend,
  url: "https://api.logflare.app",
  api_key: "${LOGFLARE_API_KEY}",
  source_id: "${LOGFLARE_SOURCE_ID}",
  flush_interval: 1_000,
  max_batch_size: 50
```

At this point, calls like `Logger.info("message", game_id: 123)` will automatically be sent to Logflare, where we can filter on a specific `game_id`.

One tip I learned when setting this up is that [Logger](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html) allows you to set metadata for the entire process with [Logger.metadata](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html#metadata/1), and Logflare has a function to do the same thing [LogflareLogger.context](https://hexdocs.pm/logflare_logger_backend/readme.html#usage-with-context).  I have a plug in my router that ensures that a game exists before sending you to the live view, so adding `LogflareLogger.context(game_id: id)` in there meant the `game_id` would be attached to every subsequent log, without having to add it explicitly each time.  This [blog article](https://timber.io/blog/elixir-logger-and-the-power-of-metadata/) goes into greater detail and was a big help.

## Alerting on Errors

With any application, you need to know when something goes wrong.  Logflare has a couple options that let you set up some basic alerting, again for free.  First, I set up a rule to send any log at the `error` level to a new source, `jeopardy.errors`.  Then I set up `jeopardy.errors` to notify me whenever it received a new event.  I opted for email and text message, but you can also enable slack notifications, or configure your own webhook.  One thing to keep in mind is that Logflare will only alert you at most every 4 hours under the free plan.  This was fine for my purposes, but if you need more immediate alerting you may need to upgrade or try a different solution.

I've been really happy with this setup, and am now considering using this configuration for things other than errors, like sending me an email when someone creates a new game.

## CI/CD
https://gist.github.com/ryoung786/b53f47ae120620fa68ab1a3a9f12dca9

https://www.mitchellhanberg.com/ci-cd-with-phoenix-github-actions-and-gigalixir/

I make heavy use of [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate my testing and deploys.  When I push or merge into the `main` branch, an action is triggered to spin up a container, check out my changes, build the app, and run the tests with `mix test`.  If the tests pass, the app is then deployed to Gigalixir with this [gigalixir action](https://github.com/mhanberg/gigalixir-action).  Finally, if the deploy is successful, I fire off a google cloud pubsub message with the [gcloud action](https://github.com/actions-hub/gcloud).  I have some Google Cloud Functions that are subscribed to that topic that record the new deploy in BigQuery.  This lets me overlay deploys on top of other graphs and metrics.

This setup is really the dream for me - commit and push some changes, and within about 4 minutes it's live on the site, with no additional work on my end.

## DNS, SSL, etc

I was already using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to handle my personal site, so it was an easy choice to come back to it again.  For basic usage, it's free offering is more than enough, and after some time spent setting things up, I've never really had to think about it.  I currently have `CNAME`s setup for SendGrid, my Metabase instance, and the Jeopardy site itself.  In case it helps anyone else, I had success with setting SSL to "flexible" for my setup.

## Email

I don't have much use for email until I decided to add the ability for users to sign in and create accounts.  While I do enable sign in with Google and Facebook, I also allow email and password registration.  With that comes the typical "forgot password" flow, where you need to send an email allowing the user to reset their password if they get locked out.  (As an aside, the [Pow](https://powauth.com/) and [PowAssent](https://hexdocs.pm/pow_assent/README.html) make all of that extremely easy for phoenix applications.)  I chose [SendGrid](sendgrid.com) to handle sending the email, and [Bamboo](https://hexdocs.pm/bamboo/readme.html) for the elixir integration.  Setting up domain authentication with SendGrid was a little bit tricky, but worth it so that my emails came from the actual website and not my personal email address.  To do that, I had to set up a `CNAME` on Cloudflare for a SendGrid subdomain with proxy status set to "DNS only".

![todo SendGrid analytics]()

After everything is set up, I can even use it to send one-off emails to myself as reactions to certain events, like so: `Jeopardy.Email.notify_new_game(game)`.

## Analytics

I didn't have much need for typical analytics for this project, but I was curious to know where my visitors where coming from.  I started with [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), but I'm testing out [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) and so far like the cleaner interface and focus on privacy.  However, it does only let you drill down to the country level (Google offers city), and will only let you see stats for the last 7 days.  Regardless, as this is more of a curiosity for me than an absolute need, either one fits the bill here.  

![todo analytics screenshot]()
Note: for both, integration is pretty straightforward - just drop a javascript snippet into the root phoenix template.

## Admin Panel
There are options out there like [Forest](https://www.forestadmin.com/), but this is one spot where I decided to roll my own.  Phoenix just makes it so easy and fun to whip up a no-frills site that there wasn't much need to bring in yet another integration.  I set it up as a guarded section of the main site, rather than a separate service or subdomain.  Phoenix plugs made it really easy to restrict access to the new routes to just my own admin account:

```elixir
  pipeline :admin do
    plug(:ensure_admin)
    plug :put_root_layout, {JeopardyWeb.LayoutView, :admin}
  end
  
  
  defp ensure_admin(conn, _opts) do
    admin_user_emails = Application.fetch_env!(:jeopardy, :admin)[:ADMIN_USER_EMAILS]

    if conn.assigns.current_user.email in admin_user_emails do
      conn
    else
      conn
      |> put_status(404)
      |> put_view(JeopardyWeb.ErrorView)
      |> render(:"404")
      |> halt()
    end
  end
  
  
  scope "/path/to/admin/area", JeopardyWeb.Admin, as: :admin do
    pipe_through [:browser, :protected, :admin]

    #...
  end
```

I currently don't take many actions from my admin area, but it's been great substitute for dropping down to the database or logs to look up something, especially if I'm not near my computer.
