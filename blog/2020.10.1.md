# Trivia and Elixir in the time of Covid
_Building a multiplayer Jeopardy game and hosting it for free_

## Inspiration
It was April in Brooklyn, and my friends and I had exhausted every online pictionary, codenames, or jackbox-type option ten times over.  Our regular game nights had shifted online and increased in frequency as we were looked for distractions and some kind of social interaction.  So with plenty of time on my hands already, why not build something myself?

Years before I had discovered the [J! Archive](http://j-archive.com/ "J! Archive"), a fan site that recorded every episode of the gameshow Jeopardy.  I'd always wanted to use that to build a trivia game using that data but balked at figuring out how to synchronize buzzers across players in real time.  I vaguely knew about websockets, but had the impression that they were still bleeding edge and would require wading further into the javascript ecosystem than I cared to go.

So when I happened to see Chris McCord's _Build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes with LiveView and Phoenix 1.5_ [demo](https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5 "demo"), I already had a project that would be perfect for learning the new language and framework.  Now properly inspired, I gave myself a few ground rules before I got to work.

## Side Project Goals
1. It must be fun to play with friends
What's the point if it was too buggy, or too slow, or, worse yet, too boring?  And keep it straightforward enough that my non-tech friends could play too.
2. Learn something new
It'd been a long time since I had picked up a new language.  I'd never even heard of elixir, but for some reason the syntax and functional approach just clicked.
3. Spend $0
As a hobby project, I wanted to spend as little as possible.  Why not take things to the extreme and try and do it all for free?


## The End Result
You can go [here](https://jeopardy.ryoung.info "url") to see the live site and even play a game or two.  Code lives on Github [here](https://github.com/ryoung786/jeopardy).


## Game Architecture
![fsm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryoung786/jeopardy/master/docs/jeopardy_rounds.png "An early version of the mid-game state machine")
Talk about FSM, ETS when possible, one liveview per role and dynamically determining component based on state.

Other fun things:
* stuck with milligram and hand-rolled css.  can go far with css animations and transitions
* minimal js.  4 hooks for podium signatures, end game stats, vibrate phone on buzz

## Hosting on Gigalixir
Generous free tier, built specifically for elixir, detailed instructions/documentation.

10k postgres record restriction
2 concurrent db connections

Cloudflare for DNS

## CI/CD with Github Actions
Github actions, plug [post](https://www.mitchellhanberg.com/ci-cd-with-phoenix-github-actions-and-gigalixir/ "Mitchell Handberg's post"), env/config variables
Could use more tests!

Also leaning on GH tools for project management (projects) and documentation (wiki).

## BI
Live Dashboard, but didn't work because it's not persistent. Metabase because free, hosted on heroku because free.  Because hosted on gigalixir and connection pool limit, couldn't get metabase to read directly from the prod postgres db.  Replicate to GCP BQ.

Wanted Stitch, couldn't get it working.

Every 5 mins, query tables for records where `replicated_at < updated_at`, write them to a csv, upload that csv to GCS, which triggers a cloud function.  The cloud function reads the csv, dumps it into BQ, then de-dupes the records to ensure ids are unique.

Cloud functions in folder within main repo -- decided better to consolidate.

Cull games older than 1 week.  Keeps records below 10k.

## Graphing Deploys
Coming from Etsy, graphing deploys

Realtime monitoring - tailing gigalixir logs has been "good enough".  Investigating timber.io's free tier.  Toyed with hosted influx and elixir's telemetry, but couldn't get it all plugged together appropriately, and the free tier persistence didn't make it particularly useful at my traffic volume.  Would love to revisit in the future.

## Admin tools
An admin section, which means creating users and admin roles, POW, POW-assent for SSO w/google and facebook.

Todo: track stats over time for logged-in players.

## Custom Games
The addition of user accounts opened the door for another feature I really wanted to build - custom games.  Originally, I thought this would be simple since the overall game/players/clues tables wouldn't need to change, but then I quickly realized it would mean introducing concepts like ownership, drafts, and permissioning.  Plus, the UX for keying in 61 questions and answers is a challenge in and of itself.

I was able to achieve most of this by adding new table `drafts` and an `owner_id` field to each record.  Checking permissions for the current logged in user against this field in the router plugs restricts access appropriately.  It also allows for users to quickly search through just their own created games.

My hope is that teachers and quiz bowl coaches could find this feature useful as a tool in the classroom.
